# Taste of the Wild

An HTML, CSS, JavaScript restaurant page.

## What is 'Taste of the Wild'?

A multipage Breath of the Wild themed restaurant site using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
The aim of the project was to make a functional multi-page restaurant website using webpack to bundle modules. Additionally, I've implemented a function for creating DOM elements by passing tag name, attributes and children.
